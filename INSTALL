Pre-Requirements:
- Running and installed pdns server which uses mysql as a backend
- php support on the webserver (php > 5.x.x should work)

Step by Step:
1. Import the install.sql file into your existant pdns database
2. Upload everything from the web folder to a folder on your server
   which is accesible via your webbrowser
3. open configs/db.php and insert your pdns db information
4. goto the url where you uploaded everything and login with admin : admin
5. CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD!!!


For extra security you can create a htdocs directory and move the img folder and the index.php to that folder,
set your webserver docroot to this folder then and prepend the includestatement in index.php with ../
I moved index.php and img to the rootfolder for not so experienced users.
